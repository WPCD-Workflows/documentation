AMNS
====

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

The EU-IM has a broad need for data relating to atomic, molecular, nuclear
and surface data (AMNS). In particular, AMNS data are needed in several
of the EU-IM modelling projects. A consistent approach, taking into
account the specific requirements of the EU-IM while maintaining the work
aligned with other European efforts in this area, is therefore required.
As a consequence the AMNS tasks are implemented as Tasks under the TF
leadership and has the following scope:

- Coordination of the work in the four different sub areas.

- Supply of data not presently residing in easily accessible data bases.

- Identify any Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection needs in
view of a broader collaboration with ITER partners.

- Provide software for delivery of AMNS data to EU-IM-TF codes

AMNS tasks
----------

The AMNS work is divided into two broad areas:

-  The maintenance and development of the AMNS library (and the
   associated AMNS CPO) to provide access to AMNS data in the various
   languages used by the codes within the Work Package
-  The addition to the AMNS database of AMNS data needed by the codes
   within the Work Package

Private AMNS pages
------------------

For access to the `private AMNS
pages <https://www.efda-itm.eu/AMNS/html/index.html>`__, an AMNS
password is needed.
